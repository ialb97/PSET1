1. Select, for each boat, the sailor who made the highest number of reservations for that boat:
	
SELECT DISTINCT B.bname, B.bid, S.sname, S.sid, COUNT(*) As 'NumRentals'
FROM  boats B JOIN reserves R ON B.bid = R.bid
              JOIN sailors S ON S.sid = R.sid
GROUP BY B.bname,B.bid, S.sname, S.sid
HAVING NumRentals >= ALL 
                (SELECT COUNT(*)
                 From reserves R1
                 WHERE R1.bid = B.bid
                 GROUP BY R1.sid)
ORDER BY B.bid



2.List, for every boat, the number of times it has been reserved, excluding those boats that have never been reserved 
(list the id and the name).:


SELECT B.bname, B.bid, COUNT(*)
FROM boats B JOIN reserves R on B.bid = R.bid
GROUP BY B.bname, B.bid
ORDER BY b.bid


3.List those sailors who have reserved every red boat (list the id and the name).


SELECT S.sid, S.sname
FROM sailors S
WHERE (SELECT Count(DISTINCT B.bid)
       FROM boats B JOIN reserves R ON B.bid = R.bid
       WHERE R.sid = S.sid AND B.color = 'red'
      )
      =
      (SELECT COUNT(B.bid)
       FROM boats B
       WHERE B.color = 'red'
      )




4.List those sailors who have reserved only red boats.

Select S.sname, S.sid
FROM sailors S
WHERE NOT EXISTS 
               (SELECT *
                FROM reserves R JOIN boats B ON R.bid = B.bid
                WHERE R.sid = S.sid AND b.color !='red'
                  )
GROUP BY S.sname, S.sid




5.For which boat are there the most reservations?:

SELECT R.bid,B.bname,COUNT(R.bid) 
FROM reserves R JOIN boats B ON R.bid=B.bid
GROUP BY R.bid
HAVING COUNT(R.bid) = (SELECT MAX(m.num)
                      FROM (SELECT R.bid,COUNT(R.bid) AS num
                      FROM reserves R
                      GROUP BY R.bid) m)


6.Select all sailors who have never reserved a red boat.:

SELECT S.sname, S.sid
FROM sailors S
WHERE S.sid != ALL (SELECT DISTINCT S1.sid
                    FROM sailors S1 JOIN reserves R ON S1.sid = R.sid
                    JOIN boats B ON R.bid = B.bid
                    WHERE B.color = 'red')


7.Find the average age of sailors with a rating of 10:

SELECT AVG(S.age)
FROM sailors S
WHERE S.rating = 10
